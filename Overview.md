Sure, let's break down the project into tasks. Here's a high-level overview of how we can execute the project:

1. **Environment Setup:**
    - Set up a development environment with the necessary tools and dependencies.
    - Create a new project folder for the survey portal.

2. **Frontend Development:**
    - Design the user interface for the survey portal, including registration and login pages.
    - Implement user registration functionality, including validation and storing user information securely.

3. **Authentication Integration:**
    - Implement a secure authentication system using a popular framework or library (e.g., Passport.js for Node.js).
    - Connect the authentication system to your user database.

4. **Dashboard Setup:**
    - Create a dashboard where users can view the surveys allocated to them.
    - Display relevant survey information such as Survey ID, Name, CPI, LOI, IR, etc.

5. **API Integration:**
    - Integrate the `/Surveys/GetAllocatedSurveys` endpoint into your backend.
    - Use the provided Staging Key (`txtTr1kFQJCFjsZ9BvyHUoc5WThDzyyW`) in the headers for authentication.

6. **Handle Survey Redirections:**
    - Implement logic to handle survey redirections based on different scenarios (Complete, Terminate, Security Terminate, Over Quota).
    - Utilize the encryption method provided to generate HMACs for secure redirection URLs.

7. **Testing:**
    - Test the registration, login, and survey allocation functionalities thoroughly.
    - Ensure that survey redirections work as expected.

8. **Documentation:**
    - Document the code, especially focusing on any complex logic or security measures implemented.
    - Create API documentation for your backend, outlining the available endpoints and how to use them.

9. **Deployment:**
    - Deploy the survey portal and backend to a staging environment for final testing.
    - Once everything is validated, deploy the application to a production environment.

10. **Monitoring and Maintenance:**
    - Implement monitoring tools to track user activity and identify any issues.
    - Set up automated backups and schedule regular maintenance tasks.

11. **User Training:**
    - If required, create user documentation explaining how to use the survey portal.
    - Provide any necessary training to end-users.

Throughout the process, be sure to communicate with the team and seek clarification on any ambiguities. Now, let's start by setting up the development environment and creating the basic structure of our project.
